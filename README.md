#### "Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand." - Martin Fowler (https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Martin_Fowler)  

#### ► Summary

I was taught early on in my computer programming career that beautiful code indicates a tidy, organised mind too - and probably leads to code that works first time, is easily understood by others and can be maintained in the years to come.

In this video we look at how we turn "prototyping code" into a well-structured, modular program by separating the various components of the program into separate files.

All the code in the video is available right here in the GitHub for you to play around with.  

#### ► Next Steps

The **next video #BB10** in this series will cover _**namespaces**_ - which does something towards getting rid of true globals. Grr!

Stay tuned!
